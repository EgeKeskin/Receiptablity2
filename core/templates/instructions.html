                    and enter your credentials. If you don’t have an account, click on <strong>Register</strong> 
                    and fill out the sign-up form. <em>You must be logged in to create a room.</em>
                </p>

            <li>
                <h3>Create a Room &amp; Upload a Receipt</h3>

                    Here, you can upload an image of your receipt. Our system will process the receipt and display 
                    its details in a unique "receipt room" page.

                    anyone who needs to view the receipt details. They can visit that link to see the receipt 
                    information without logging in.
