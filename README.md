## Objectives
&lt;Receiptability is a full service web application that enables users to scan and itemize receipts. The app then allows users to join "Tables" where they can split and itemize each receipt. Underlying the app, there is a software that gamifies the splitting of the receipt, enabling the users to take risks on payment in exchange to potential pay more or less than their order. Our app uses OCR and AI technology to scan each receipt. Django is the primary tech stak our group utilized.&gt;
